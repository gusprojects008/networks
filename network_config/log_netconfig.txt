DEPRECATION: Loading egg at /path/to/new/virtual/environment/lib/python3.12/site-packages/binwalk-2.3.3+cddfede-py3.12.egg is deprecated. pip 24.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to use pip for package installation. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12330
